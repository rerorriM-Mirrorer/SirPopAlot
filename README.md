Overview

SirPopaLot is an addon for FFXI that simplifies trading items, spawning NMs, interacting with NPCs, and handling various in-game systems based on your current target.

It detects what you're targeting and performs the correct action (trade, menu navigation, warp, etc.).

SirPopAlot does NOT use packets, and does NOT do AFK automations.

## Experimental SlowEnter integration

The branch `work/slowenter-signet-2026-10-06` preserves one experimental change migrated from the old NPCMirror workspace:

- `Milma-Hapilma, W.W.` uses `slowenter on;wait 5;slowenter off` after opening the menu instead of one immediate Enter tap.

This was kept as a work branch because it was noted as a temporary Signet-NPC-style workaround, not established as canonical SirPopAlot behavior. It requires the separate SlowEnter addon: https://github.com/rerorriM-Mirrorer/SlowEnter

Live-check the interaction before considering a merge to `main`.
